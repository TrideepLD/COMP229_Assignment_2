Expected Above and Beyond:

Mostly Aesthetics

What I plan to do:
Have faces for all actors by adding black poly for nose, eyes and whiskers
Maybe chuck some instructions
Also Pormpts, as many as I can.

What I did:
Added end turn and exit menu in fire
And a few comments to understand what is happening
