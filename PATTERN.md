This is the pattern I chose to use

I was deciding between like state pattern vs strategy pattern as cause Strategy pattern allows me to like store the cases in a strategy format but upon listening to the video and such and understanding that state basically stores information I decided to have a second look.
Since Everything in mouseClicked is based on the states, and these state have some sort of information in them, I would use the state pattern.
